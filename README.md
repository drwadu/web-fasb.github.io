# web-fasb

The prototypical web application of some functionalities provided by the
faceted answer set browser [fasb](https://github.com/drwadu/fasb).

The compiled [command line tool](https://github.com/drwadu/fasb) is more efficient &
provides more functionality.

This implementation is very basic and not considered stable by any means. 

web-fasb is highly inspired by
[potassco.org/clingo/run/](https://potassco.org/clingo/run/). Most parts are
based on [clingo-wasm](https://github.com/domoritz/clingo-wasm) and
[webclingo-example](https://github.com/Aluriak/webclingo-example).
